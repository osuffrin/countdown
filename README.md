# countdown
counts down the time left until a specific date and DMs it to users on Twitter.


It's not a perfect script. For example, it doesn't congratulate you on your birthday, and you have to manually update if it's a recurring event, but it does the job of urging you to get off the couch and start doing things because time is passing, and it does it well.


*** You must put your Twitter API keys in the "__twitter_api" function inside the "Countdown" class, otherwise you will receive an error ***



Peace and Love:)
